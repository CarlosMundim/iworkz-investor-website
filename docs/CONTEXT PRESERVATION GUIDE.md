2. **Review Google Drive project artifacts** for detailed specifications
3. **Coordinate with Manus** for any documentation updates needed
4. **Sync with Chattie** for business plan alignment and sprint priorities

### **For Documentation Updates:**

## üìû Emergency Context Recovery

**If memory/context is completely lost:**

1. **Ask for this file:** "Please share MEMORANDUM-CLAUDE.md and CURRENT-SPRINT.md"
2. **Request business plan:** "Link me to the Google Drive business plan"
3. **Verify current status:** "What's our immediate sprint priority?"
4. **Confirm team structure:** "Who should I coordinate with for [specific task]?"

**Key Phrase for Context Reset:**
*"I need a full iWORKZ context refresh - I'm the Lead Engineer but need to reload my platform understanding."*
